                <p>
                    So, strange thing happened, I got an email from iFixit stating
                    that they were opening an <a href="http://eustore.ifixit.com/" target="_blank">EU Store</a>
                    and passing on press release asking that I post about it and
                    me not in any way part of the press... Given that I'm such a
                    nice fellow I figured I'd post it. Also given that I've ordered
                    things from iFixit and found it to be of high quality and a
                    very good service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I really like what the people at iFixit are doing and think
                    everyone should do similar. There is no need to get into the
                    throw away mindset that seems to be taking over the world
                    these days, except maybe for cost. Which if you think about
                    it is rediculous. Why is it cheaper to buy something than it
                    is to buy the parts of it and put it together your self
                    (not including any delivery of the parts).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyway Press Release below:

Stuttgart, Germany, October 24, 2013

Repair is better than recycling: iFixit comes to Europe.

iFixit, an online repair manual for everything, is coming to Europe. With a new online
store based in Germany, the DIY specialists are now offering EU customers a selection
of their most popular parts and tools. iFixit is now shipping to 28 European countries
from its new European headquarters.

Launching the iFixit EU Store is just the first step: The company aims to support Europe's
growing repair movement. iFixit is a well known advocate for longer lasting products and
the environmental benefit of repair; their easy-to-follow, step-by-step repair guides
range from iPhones to automobiles.

"We are helping people reduce their resource consumption," state Matthias Huisken and
Matthias Mayer, managing directors of the newly-founded iFixit GmbH. "We make it possible
for people to use the products that they love even longer. We provide an alternative to
disposable product strategies. Customers are being victimized by predefined life cycles
and disempowered by planned obsolescence. With free online guides and our tools and
parts, we are enabling people to take matters into their own hands again. "
